Business Problem:
Home Credit, a financial services company, aims to increase financial inclusion by offering loans to individuals with limited or no formal credit history. However, the absence of traditional credit data poses a challenge in assessing these borrowers’ repayment capacity accurately. To prevent financially vulnerable clients from being rejected or overburdened by unmanageable loans, Home Credit seeks a more reliable predictive model to determine loan applicants’ repayment abilities. This model will not only improve client satisfaction but will also support sustainable lending practices by minimizing loan defaults.
